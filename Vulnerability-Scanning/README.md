# 🛡️ Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap & Nessus

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases vulnerability assessment using Nmap and Nessus. It scans a test environment to identify open ports, OS types, and known vulnerabilities.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Nmap
- Nessus Essentials
- Kali Linux / Ubuntu VM
- Windows 10 VM

## 🧪 Scanning Steps
- Performed TCP/UDP scans with Nmap
- Enumerated OS and services
- Conducted full Nessus scan on target machine

## 🗂️ Project Files
- `nmap/nmap-scan-results.txt`: Full service/port scan output
- `nessus/nessus-findings.pdf`: Nessus PDF report
- `SOC-report.md`: Structured analysis with mitigation steps

## 📸 Screenshots

## 🛡️ Sample Nmap Command
```bash
nmap -sS -sV -O 192.168.1.10
🎯 Outcome
This project helps identify exposed services and security misconfigurations using automated scanners.

## 📄 Sample SOC-style Report (`SOC-report.md`)

Here's a reusable template for all your SOC reports:

```markdown
# 🧾 SOC Report: [Project Title]

## 🧠 Summary
A brief overview of the incident or assessment. Describe what was detected, analyzed, or scanned.

## 📍 Environment
- Machines involved: Ubuntu, Windows 10
- Tools used: [e.g., Splunk, Wireshark, Nmap, Nessus]
- Timeframe: [Date range]

## ⚠️ Detection/Findings
| Type | Description | Source IP | Target IP | Timestamp |
|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Failed Logins | 6 login failures for same user | 192.168.1.10 | 192.168.1.2 | 2025-06-01 12:33:00 |
| ARP Spoof | Duplicate ARP requests | 192.168.1.50 | 192.168.1.1 | 2025-06-01 12:45:10 |
| CVE-2021-34527 | PrintNightmare vuln on Win10 | 192.168.1.10 | - | Scanned at 2025-06-01 |

## 🎯 Actions Taken
- Created alert rule in Splunk for repeated login failures
- Captured traffic using Wireshark and blocked attacker MAC
- Patched Windows VM after detecting Nessus critical vulnerability

## 🛡️ Recommendations
- Enforce multi-factor authentication
- Monitor logs using SIEM rules
- Regularly patch systems and limit network access
